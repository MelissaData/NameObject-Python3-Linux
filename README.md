## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

This project is compatible with Python3

#### Install Python3
Before starting, make sure that Python3 has been correctly installed on your machine and your environment paths are configured. 

You can download Python here: 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

You can check that your environment is set up correctly by opening a command prompt window and typing the following:
`python3 --version`

If you see the version number then you have installed Python3 and set up your environment paths correctly!

----------------------------------------

#### Download this project
```
git clone https://github.com/MelissaData/NameObject-Python3-Linux
cd NameObject-Python3-Linux
```

#### Set up Melissa Updater 
Melissa Updater is a CLI application allowing the user to update their Melissa applications/data. 

- In the root directory of the project, create a folder called `MelissaUpdater` by using the command: 

  `mkdir MelissaUpdater`

- Enter the newly created folder using the command:

  `cd MelissaUpdater`

- Proceed to install the Melissa Updater using the curl command: 

  `curl -L -O https://releases.melissadata.net/Download/Library/LINUX/NET/ANY/latest/MelissaUpdater`

- After the Melissa Updater is installed, you will need to change the Melissa Updater to an executable using the command:

  `chmod +x MelissaUpdater`

- Now that the Melissa Updater is set up, you can now proceed to move back into the project folder by using the command:
  
   `cd ..`

----------------------------------------

#### Different ways to get data file(s)
1.  Using Melissa Updater
    - It will handle all of the data download/path and .so file(s) for you. 
2.  If you already have the latest DQS release zip, you can find the data file(s) in there
    - To pass in your own data file path directory, you may either use the '--dataPath' parameter or enter the data file path directly in interactive mode.
    - Comment out this line "DownloadDataFiles $license" in the bash script.
    - This will prevent you from having to redownload all the files.
	
----------------------------------------
### Change Bash Script Permissions
To be able to run the bash script, you must first make it an executable using the command:

`chmod +x MelissaNameObjectLinuxPython3.sh`

Then you need to add permissions to the build directory with the command:

`chmod +rwx MelissaNameObjectLinuxPython3`

As an indicator, the filename will change colors once it becomes an executable.

You may also need to alter permissions for the python files. To do this navigate into the MelissaNameObjectLinuxPython3 directory and run these commands: \
 `chmod +rx MelissaNameObjectLinuxPython3/MelissaNameObjectLinuxPython3.py` \
  `chmod +rx MelissaNameObjectLinuxPython3/mdName_pythoncode.py`

## Run Bash Script
Parameters:
- --name: a test name
 	
  This is convenient when you want to get results for a specific name in one run instead of testing multiple names in interactive mode.  

- --dataPath (optional): a data file path directory to test the Name Object
- --license (optional): a license string to test the Name Object
- --quiet (optional): add to the command if you do not want to get any console output from the Melissa Updater

- Interactive 

  The script will prompt the user for an name, then use the provided name to test Name Object. For example:
  ```
  ./MelissaNameObjectLinuxPython3.sh
  ```
  For quiet mode:
  ```
  ./MelissaNameObjectLinuxPython3.sh -quiet
  ```
- Command Line 

  You can pass a name in ```--name``` parameter and a license string in ```--license``` parameter to test Name Object. For example:
  ```
  ./MelissaNameObjectLinuxPython3.sh --name "Ray Melissa" 
  ./MelissaNameObjectLinuxPython3.sh --name "Ray Melissa" --license "<your_license_string>"
  ```
  For quiet mode:
  ```
  ./MelissaNameObjectLinuxPython3.sh --name "Ray Melissa" --quiet
  ./MelissaNameObjectLinuxPython3.sh --name "Ray Melissa" --license "<your_license_string>" --quiet
  ```
This is the expected output from a successful setup for interactive mode:
